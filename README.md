# Machine-Learning
This repository is a set of programs and small projects, done mostly in Python, exploring various machine learning-based techniques commonly used in data science.
## Cryptography in Python
The file crypto.py is a simple Python program that can take in a string or strings of words as input. The phrase can either be an already encrypted phrase to be decrypted, or a phrase to encrypt. The program has various encryption schemes, such as Atbash, Caesar, and N-Shift. 
## Cryptography in C++
The file cryptography.cpp is a similar file as the one in Python, however extended to be in C++.
